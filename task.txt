Goal
Build a small application where a user submits an email from a web page, a background job processes it using
BullMQ, and the frontend tracks job completion.
Tech Stack
Backend: Node.js, Express.js, BullMQ, Redis
Frontend: React / Vue
Backend Requirements
1. Create Job API
POST /jobs
Request body:
{ "email": "user@example.com" }
• Email is required (return 400 if missing)
• Add job to a BullMQ queue called email-queue
• Return jobId in response
2. Worker
• Worker runs separately from Express
• Wait 2 seconds to simulate email sending
• Log: Email sent to user@example.com
• If email contains 'fail', throw an error
• Retry job 1 time
3. Job Status API
GET /jobs/:id
Return job status: waiting, active, completed, or failed
Return 404 if job does not exist
Frontend Requirements
• Input field for email
• Submit button
• Display job status on screen
Flow:
1. Submit email
2. Call POST /jobs
3. Receive jobId
4. Poll GET /jobs/:id every 2 seconds
5. Show job status and stop when completed or failed
